# UltrasoundImgRecon

This study systematically evaluates different CNN architectures, including U-Net, MobileNet, and CNN for adaptive ultrasound image reconstruction.The implementation can be found in the code snippet titled usimgrecon.py

The code can be easily implemented and hosted on Google Colab that provides hardware support for training the network. With a hardware accelerator (GPU) the speed of execution is manifold greater.

The implementation pipleine is given below, where the neural network can be simple CNN,  obilenet and U-Net.

This study presented a comparative analysis of CNN, MobileNet, and U-Net architectures for image reconstruction tasks using MAE, MSE, and SSIM metrics. The U-Net model demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest error rates and highest structural similarity, making it highly effective for high-fidelity tasks.
